 Are games getting worse?
 One of my hobbies is playing online games with my friends, and as we were looking for a game to play, an argument arose about whether games are getting worse. As I'm entering the Data Analysis universe, I decided to look for a database and perform an analysis to answer the following question raised by my friends: "Are games getting worse?"
Shall I start?
Well, at first I imported the necessary python language libraries and then loaded the database.
Once loaded, I decided to check the data type in each column and if there was any null data that could mess up my analysis. After processing the data, I realized that the total number of games was equal to the total number of user and critic ratings per year, since for each game there was a user and critic rating. So when making the "Year by Total Number of Games" graph I would be looking at two other similar graphs ("Year by Total User Ratings" and "Year by Total Critics Ratings").
